# SEAMIS 
This repository contains the Holocene database for SE Asia, Maldives, India and Sri Lanka and GIA models (ICE5G), and scripts to plot data and models.

## Database
The folder ..\SEAMIS_database contains the different database versions. 

## Scripts
The folder ..\Sea_level_plots contains the file "SEALEVELPLOTS.m" that can be used to plot GIA model outputs and RSL observations in RSL *vs* Time graphs. The graphs include symbols for sea level index points, marine and terrestrial limiting points.

The folder \Sea level plots\Models contains the file "PLOT_Maps.m" that can be used to plot GIA maps for the study area. An example of the output is shown below.</br>

The scripts are written in MATLAB 2016b.
The PLOT_Maps scripts needs the Matlab Mapping Toolbox. 
The SEALEVELPLOTS scripts works with MATLAB 2016b, MATLAB 2015b has a problem with the errorbar function
