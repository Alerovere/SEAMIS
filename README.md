# SEAMIS data analysis tools
This repository contains the Holocene database for SE Asia, Maldives, India and Sri Lanka and GIA models (ICE5G). 

The repository also contains scripts to plot data and models:

The folder \Sea level plots contains the file "SEALEVELPLOTS.m" that can be used to plot GIA model outputs and RSL observations in RSL/Time graphs. </br>
</br>

</br>

The folder \Sea level plots\Models contains the file "PLOT_Maps.m" that can be used to plot GIA maps for the study area. An example of the output is below.</br>

</br>

The scripts are written in MATLAB 2016b.
The PLOT_Maps scripts needs the Matlab Mapping Toolbox. 
The SEALEVELPLOTS scripts works with MATLAB 2016b, MATLAB 2015b has a problem with the errorbar function
